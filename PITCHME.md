# git and GitHub 

An explanation of version control and tooling with git and GitHub

---

### Version Control System (VCS)

- Tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. 
- Keeps versions of your code. Ex: Saving a word document.

1. Which changes were made?
2. Who made the changes?
3. When were the changes made?
4. Why were changes needed?
---

### git

- `git` is a distributed VCS.
- **Every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes**
---

### Important terms

#### Repository
- `git` project. Directory with `.git` folder
-  The entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each fileâ€™s revision history. 

---
#### Commit
- The file history appears as snapshots in time called commits (like a picture), which are linked together and can be separated in branches
- Each commit log has who made the commit, when, what and why they were made. **You provide why/what**
- Rule of thumb: commit what you wouldn't want to lose.

---
- Commit message should be 
  - < 50 characters
  - A present tense action verb (`Add`/`Update`) followed by what was changed

#### Branch
- A list of commits in a separate unit.
